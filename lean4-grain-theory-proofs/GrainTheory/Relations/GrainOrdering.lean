  GrainTheory.Relations.GrainOrdering — Grain ordering (partial order)

  PODS Definition 5: R₁ ≤_g R₂ iff ∃ surjective f : G[R₁] ↠ G[R₂].

  Grain ordering arises in two ways, both yielding surjective functions:
  (1) Subset-based: G[R₂] ⊆_typ G[R₁] yields a surjective projection.
  (2) FD-based: a surjective functional dependency from G[R₁] to G[R₂]
      without field overlap (e.g., EmployeeId ↠ DepartmentId).

  In this abstract axiomatization, we encode grain ordering via (1):
  `grainLe R₁ R₂ := sub (grain R₂) (grain R₁)`. The subset case
  implies surjectivity (the projection is surjective), and all proof
  machinery (Armstrong axioms, GIT, equi-join) operates through this
  path. The FD-based case (2) cannot be expressed abstractly since
  DataType `D` carries no internal function types.

  PODS Theorem (Grain Ordering is a Partial Order):
  ≤_g is a partial order up to grain equivalence:
  reflexive, antisymmetric (up to ≅), and transitive.

/-- PODS Def 5: Grain ordering. R₁ ≤_g R₂ iff ∃ surjective f : G[R₁] ↠ G[R₂].
    Encoded via the subset case: G[R₂] ⊆_typ G[R₁] (the projection is
    surjective because every field of G[R₂] exists in G[R₁]).
    "R₁ has lower grain (finer granularity) than R₂."
    Example: OrderDetail ≤_g Order, since G[Order] ⊆_typ G[OrderDetail]. -/

/-! ## PODS Theorem: Grain Ordering is a Partial Order (thm:grain-partial-order)

  ≤_g is a partial order (up to isomorphism):
  - Reflexivity: R ≤_g R (identity is surjective).
  - Antisymmetry: R₁ ≤_g R₂ ∧ R₂ ≤_g R₁ → R₁ ≡_g R₂.
    Proof: surjective f : G[R₁] ↠ G[R₂] implies |G[R₁]| ≥ |G[R₂]|;
    surjective g : G[R₂] ↠ G[R₁] implies the reverse. Equal cardinality
    makes f a bijection, hence G[R₁] ≅ G[R₂].
    In the subset encoding: sub_antisymm gives iso directly.
  - Transitivity: R₁ ≤_g R₂ ∧ R₂ ≤_g R₃ → R₁ ≤_g R₃
    (composition of surjections is surjective).

/-! ## Corollary: Grain Ordering Preservation -/

/-- PODS Corollary (Grain Ordering Preservation):
    R₁ ≤_g R₂ ⟺ G[R₁] ≤_g G[R₂].

    Both directions follow from idempotency G[G[R]] ≅ G[R],
    using iso_sub to transport the sub relation across the
    grain_idempotent isomorphism.

    (⟹) grainLe R₁ R₂ = sub (grain R₂) (grain R₁).
    Chain: grain(grain R₂) ⊆ grain R₂ ⊆ grain R₁ ≅ grain(grain R₁),
    so sub (grain(grain R₂)) (grain(grain R₁)) = grainLe (grain R₁) (grain R₂).

    (⟸) Same argument in reverse, using iso_symm of grain_idempotent. -/
